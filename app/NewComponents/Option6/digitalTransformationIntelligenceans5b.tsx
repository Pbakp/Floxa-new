            Based on competitor analysis, data quality preparation is your highest risk factor - this caused
            MegaCorp&apos;s â‚¬2.7M failure. Your organization&apos;s strong data infrastructure (78% readiness) mitigates this
            risk significantly. The main challenges will be change management (23% readiness) and technical skills
            development (45% readiness), both addressable through structured training and phased
            implementation.
