            I&apos;ve analyzed your digital maturity across all platforms. Your organization shows strong data integration
            (73%) and good AI readiness infrastructure (67%), but significant opportunity exists in process
            automation (45%). Your Microsoft 365 deployment is well-utilized, but there are integration gaps
            between Atlassian and HubSpot that present AI implementation opportunities.
